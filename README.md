Welcome to **Python Project Repository**. This Repository contains a collection of python core project using pandas and numpy.

**Table of Contents**

**Introduction:**

Overview of the project
Purpose of the recommendation system
Types of recommendation systems (Content-based, Collaborative, Hybrid)

**Dataset Overview:**

Source of the dataset (e.g., MovieLens, Kaggle, custom data)
Key features in the dataset (e.g., user ID, movie ID, ratings, genres)
Data exploration and visualization

**Data Preprocessing:**

Cleaning the dataset (handling missing values, duplicates)
Feature engineering (e.g., genre encoding, normalizing ratings)
Splitting data into training and testing sets

**Building the Recommendation System**

**Content-Based Filtering:**

Using movie metadata (e.g., genres, descriptions)
Implementing cosine similarity or TF-IDF

**Collaborative Filtering:**

User-based vs. Item-based methods
Matrix factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD)

**Hybrid Methods:**

Combining content-based and collaborative filtering
